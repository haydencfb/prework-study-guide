# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project contains information and notes gathered during the beginning portion of the course (pre course). The motivation for completing this project was to successfully set myself up for success come the beginning of the class. I built this project as a means of reflection upon information I gathered that will provide a base foundation for myself during the course. This project solves the problem of having a direct place to store notes and quick access information I may need during the course. I began to learn and am continuing to learn about Git and all of the useful resources that are attached with it, and how these resourses can be of use to myself in and out of this program.

## Usage

Prior to enrollment in this course, I have learned basic HTML and CSS through mutliple classes I have taken in highschool, and an introductory course to Java in my last semester of recieving my bachelors degree. The usage for this project serves as a means of reflection to information I have previously recieved about these three languages, as well as provided new contexts and information to further resources. This study guide can be used for future reflection and documentation of information I have learned, am learning, and am continuing to learn moving foward!
